# Kivun-demo
Create your own fullstack app
# Introduction
Welcome to the Full Stack Mentor project! This initiative is designed to assist inexperienced programmers in developing a small, full stack, end-to-end system. Leveraging React for UI/UX design, Node.js for server-side logic, and the Notion API for database functionalities, Full Stack Mentor provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide that simplifies the learning process. Our goal is to make the journey into full stack development as clear, approachable, and rewarding as possible.
# Project Overview
UI/UX Design with React: Learn to build intuitive and dynamic user interfaces.
Server-Side Development with Node.js: Master the basics of server-side logic and functionality.
Database Integration with Notion API: Utilize Notion as your application's database for real-time data management.
Structured Guidance: From project planning to deployment, receive detailed instructions and development tips.
Supportive Learning Environment: Gain confidence with supportive, patient guidance tailored to beginners.
# Getting Started
# 1. Creating a New Project
ReactJS:
bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app kivun-demo
ReactTS:
bash
Copy code
# Using NPM
npx create-react-app@latest kivun-demo --template typescript --use-npm
# Alternatively
npx create-react-app kivun-demo --template typescript
After creating your project, move to v0.dev to design your application's interface.
# 2. Setting Up Your Development Environment
Visual Studio Code Installation: Download and install VS Code from the official website. It's a powerful IDE that supports JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js out of the box.
IDE Configuration: Familiarize yourself with VS Code's interface. Explore the integrated terminal, source control management, and extension marketplace to enhance your development workflow.
# 3. Running Your Application
Open your project in VS Code.
Open the integrated terminal.
Run your application with:
bash
Copy code
npm start
View your application on localhost in your web browser.
# 4. Server Integration with Node.js
Set up your Node.js environment and create a simple server to manage backend processes. Detailed guidance on this will be provided as you progress.
# 5. For advanced users: Creating API Calls
Notion API Integration: Follow these steps to connect your application to the Notion database:
Secret Key: Create an integration on Notion and obtain your secret key via Notion Integrations.
Database ID: Create a new database page in Notion with a table, and copy the URL's unique part from ? to /.
Table Headers: Ensure your table headers in Notion match the headers in your CSV file for seamless integration.
Sharing: Enable sharing on your Notion database for accessibility.
